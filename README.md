# pyjgeutil
Collection of Python Utility libraries utility tools relating to math, physics, computer science by Jerry G Eldridge.

Some of the scripts like graphics_cv.py use opencv-python (https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and others
like BasicShapes.py use 3D Viewer from the recent Windows Fall Creator's Update for viewing 3D .obj files for graphics.
Most scripts are text based and use Python27 like WinPython27 (http://winpython.sourceforge.net/) for running the
the scripts. extrusion.py uses tripy (https://pypi.org/project/tripy/).

Requirements

Winpython27 and in its command shell:

'pip install opencv-python'
'pip install tripy'
